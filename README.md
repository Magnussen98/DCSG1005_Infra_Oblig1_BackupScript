## Problem description / Goal of this project

I was assigned the task to write a ransomware-protection script in PowerShell. The requirments
given to me alloved me to interpret, analyse and implement the script based on my own reflection
and research. The goal of this project is to find the best-practises for ransomware protection, and being able to
implement these measures into a solid powershell script.    

## Design / Solution

Justify/explain your design

## Discussion, incl security aspects

How does your solution compare to others you find on the Internet, what are
benefits, negative sides, what should have been done differently? Think
security: can this solution be misused somehow?

## Conclusion and Reflection

reflect over your solution and work process, everything have gone according to
plan? what do you achieve or not achieve? what took more time than you expected
