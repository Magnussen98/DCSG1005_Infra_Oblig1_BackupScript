# Portifolio 1; Ransomware protection with PowerShell

THE GIT REPO FOR THIS PORTFOLIO 1 IS: https://gitlab.stud.iie.ntnu.no/andrefm/portifolio1

[[_TOC_]]

## Problem description / Goal of this project

I was assigned the task to write a ransomware-protection script in PowerShell. The requirments
given to me alloved me to interpret, analyse and implement the script based on my own reflection
and research. The goal of this project is to find the best-practises for ransomware protection, and being able to
implement these measures into a solid powershell script.    

## Design / Solution

I have a created a script, which enables multiple safety precautions for ransomware attacks. The different precautions I
have chosen to include in my script is;
1. [Controlled Folder Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/enable-controlled-folders)
2. [Backup to external hardisk](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Top-five-ways-backup-can-protect-against-ransomware)
3. [Encryption](https://cyberx.tech/does-encryption-prevent-ransomware/)  

## Discussion, incl security aspects

How does your solution compare to others you find on the Internet, what are
benefits, negative sides, what should have been done differently? Think
security: can this solution be misused somehow?

## Conclusion and Reflection

reflect over your solution and work process, everything have gone according to
plan? what do you achieve or not achieve? what took more time than you expected

(remember to link to sources, e.g. if you have read about [Backup on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Backup&oldid=998232746),
also not how I just linked to the static Wikipedia-page and not the dynamic one)
